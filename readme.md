## **1. Installation**

### Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

---

## **2. Variables and Data Types**

Variables in Python are used to store data, which can be of various types:

### Example:
```python
# Variable declaration
name = "Python"
age = 3
height = 1.75
is_programming_language = True

# Print variable types
print(type(name))    # <class 'str'>
print(type(age))     # <class 'int'>
print(type(height))  # <class 'float'>
print(type(is_programming_language))  # <class 'bool'>
```

---

## **3. Operators**

Python supports various operators for performing arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operations.

### Example:
```python
# Arithmetic operators
a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)  # Addition
print(a - b)  # Subtraction
print(a * b)  # Multiplication
print(a / b)  # Division

# Comparison operators
print(a > b)  # Greater than
print(a < b)  # Less than
```

---

## **4. Control Structures**

Control structures allow you to dictate the flow of your program.

### Example:
```python
# If-else statement
number = 10
if number > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif number < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")

# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

---

## **5. Functions**

Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.

### Example:
```python
# Function definition
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Function call
print(greet("Python"))  # Output: Hello, Python!
```

---

## **6. Data Structures**

Python includes several built-in data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

### Example:
```python
# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple

# Tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates[1])  # Output: 20

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice
```

---

## **7. Modules and Libraries**

Modules are files containing Python code. Libraries are collections of modules.

### Example:
```python
# Importing a module
import math

# Using a function from the module
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0

# Importing specific functions
from math import pi

print(pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793
```

---

## **8. File Handling**

Python can read and write files.

### Example:
```python
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)  # Output: Hello, Python!
```

---

## **9. Object-Oriented Programming**

Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes and objects.

### Example:
```python
# Class definition
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Creating an object
my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

---

## **10. Error Handling**

Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions.

### Example:
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

---

## **11. Common Libraries**

### NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

### Example:
```python
import numpy as np

# Creating an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(arr.mean())  # Output: 2.5
```
